Unit Tests Synopsis
===================
This topic introduces [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html), the AngularJS unit test framework .

Notes on Unit Tests
===================
Automated testing has become essential to modern software construction, particularly for complex enterprise solutions prone to grow in depth and bredth with the passage of time. AngularJS offers a very rich automated testing capability covering unit tests and integration (a.k.a scenario or end-to-end) tests. This topic covers Angular unit tests. Although it starts relatively simple, it quickly becomes a very complex subject; your success in using AngularJS will be directly linked to your ability to cover your solutions with a robust set of unit tests. Therefore, do not cut any corners here, this is a critical topic.
