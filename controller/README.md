Learning Objectives
===================
Collect your answers to the questions and exercises below and forward them to your instructor. Please include links to the plunkers you wrote.
* What is an AngularJS controller?
* How does the ng-click directive works?
* Explain what happens when you click on the [Angular Boot-camp - Controllers - Basic](http://plnkr.co/edit/pTfVgRvmehxVeGNsqINx?p=preview) plunker Add button.
* Fork the [Angular Boot-camp - Controllers - Basic](http://plnkr.co/edit/pTfVgRvmehxVeGNsqINx?p=preview) plunker. Re-factor it to support the ability to change the amount being added and subtracted from the counter.
* Why is it a good practice to made DOM HTML changes inside a controller?
* Fork the [Angular Boot-camp - Controllers - Basic](http://plnkr.co/edit/pTfVgRvmehxVeGNsqINx?p=preview) plunker. Re-factor it to perform the current exercise:
  * Wrap the #inside div with an #outside div
  * Add an OutsideController to the #outside div
  * Move the definition of the computationalMachine object to the OutsideController; keep the computations on the ComputationalMachineController.
  * Describe the bugs you run into while doing this exercise.
