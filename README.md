Logistics
=========
You will learn based on a combination of studying a topic, using the learned concept(s) to build working software, interacting with your learning mates and tutor as well as the project manager.

* The boot camp consists of a series of topics to be covered one at a time.
Topics will be grouped into sprints, with each sprint being one day long. There might topics that span one or more sprints.
* The instructions will be vague as they generally are in real life projects. You must look for support and guidance from your teammates,  tutors, and project manager.
* You will interact with your learning mates via a chat room (Bootcamp AngularJS - Students), available for students to interact with each other and share knowledge.
* Tutors will be available to answer technical questions on a given chat room (Bootcamp AngularJS - Team), available to the boot camp team (students, tutors and PMs). 
* We intend to provide you with the links and references, and didactic material required for you to complete and and all of the lesson plans.  
  * You are expected to be as self sufficient as practical. 
  * Your main source of assistance must be your boot camp learning colleagues.
  * You are encouraged to help your learning colleagues to the extent that it is practical. 
  * The chat rooms are key learning tools
  * Your assigned tutor and the project manager are also a key learning resources.
  + The chat rooms are also key learning tools
* Should you be able to complete a learning lesson ahead of your learning mates, feel free to move forward. You are also encouraged to engage your classmates and assist them.
* All code and documentation must be in English.
* Code must adhere to Globant’s [UI HTML](https://github.com/globant-ui/html-style-guide), [CSS] (https://github.com/globant-ui/css-style-guide) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/globant-ui/JavaScript-style-guide) coding guidelines.
* Each boot camp student will be evaluated individually.
* Code review after each practice and sprint
* Checkpoint completion after Learning stage with your assigned tutor

Topics
======
Following is a list of topics and their summary. For topics with developed lesson plans, their titles are linked to these lessons.

[The basics of AngularJS](https://github.com/globant-ui/angular-bootcamp/blob/master/basics/README.md)
-----------------------
The goal of this topic is to get you comfortable with the terminology and technology and to give you a very high level understanding about how AngularJS works.

[Data binding](https://github.com/globant-ui/angular-bootcamp/tree/master/data-binding)
------------
You will build an AngularJS application, even if you never written one before and get an extended feel for how AngularJS works.

[Modules](https://github.com/globant-ui/angular-bootcamp/tree/master/modules)
-------
In this topic you will learn how to write efficient production-ready solutions encapsulating related functionality into modules.

[Scopes](https://github.com/globant-ui/angular-bootcamp/tree/master/scopes)
------
In this topic you will learn about the scope, a core AngularJS concept, and how it is used as the source of truth throughout AngularJS.

[Controllers](https://github.com/globant-ui/angular-bootcamp/tree/master/controller)
-----------
In this topic you will learn about the AngularJS controller, a function used to initialize and maintain your view’s scope.

Expressions
-----------
Expressions are used throughout AngularJS. In this topic you will learn about AngularJS expressions, how they are evaluated, and how to use them.

Unit Tests
----------
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language which comes with great power of expression, but it also comes with almost no help from the compiler. For this reason any code written in JavaScript needs to come with a strong set of tests. AngularJS has many built-in features which makes testing your Angular applications easy. So there is no excuse for not testing.
